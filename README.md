# SQLiteManager

Manage SQLite databases in ESP32 using the [Sqlite3Esp32 library](https://github.com/siara-cc/esp32_arduino_sqlite3_lib) with a C++ API wrapper.

This is a fork of the [SQLiteDatabaseManager library](https://github.com/Zhu-jiatong/SQLiteDatabaseManager) with a few improvements:

  - Uses [ArduinoJson](https://arduinojson.org) instead of [Arduino_JSON](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_JSON)
  - Provides enhanced support for additional data types
  - Offers a more intuitive interface for database operations
